<h1>A doctor and a geek perspective: Why Open API Standards in the NHS matter</h1>
<p>Carl Reynolds and Terence Eden</p>
<h2 id="background---what-did-the-internet-ever-do-for-us-anyway">Background - what did the internet ever do for us anyway?</h2>
<p>The Internet provides unparalleled opportunity for the efficient matching of skills to tasks (&quot;work&quot;).</p>
<p>Internet works on &quot;rough consensus and running code&quot;. If we all speak (roughly) the same language, we can accomplish great things.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-that-work">How does that work?</h2>
<p>By making it easier for people to connect; reduces organisational, geographic and fianancial barriers; there's a big pool of people on the internet with a plurality of skill and motivation; they can find work they're a good match for or start their own for a low marginal cost.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-it-matter">Why does it matter?</h2>
<p>No one organisation (or individual) owns all the talent. Being (selectively) open to contributions from a bigger pool of talent (people on the internet) results in better work. It's the open source model.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Android (based on Linux), the most popular smartphone operating system in the world</li>
<li>Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, the three most popular web browsers in the world</li>
<li>Python, R, Ruby, Java, four of the most popular programming languages in the world</li>
<li>Twitter, reddit, linkedin, instagram, amazon - all built using open standards.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-open-api-standards-have-to-do-with-the-price-of-cheese">What do Open API Standards have to do with the price of cheese?</h2>
<p>Open API standards can help to lower barrier to entry (contributing), lowering costs. They can also improve interoperability. More hygenic / scalable design practice? Modularity is good.</p>
<p>Open APIs stop the NHS from getting locked in to monopolies. Anyone can supply software that reads and produces data in an open standard.</p>
<h2 id="are-sdos-our-friends">Are SDOs our friends?</h2>
<p>Standards devlelopment organizations are not our unqualified friends. Standard setting is a key part of modern business strategy, the stakes are high, it's a warzone. Basic checks that it's open. Reminder that open source still matters.</p>
<p>We have an extensive list of checks to make sure that standards meet our needs - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles</p>
<h2 id="openapi-v3">OpenAPI v3</h2>
<p>Formerly known as Swagger. A brilliant way to document APIs. Allows for rapid creation of code. Lets API designers understand what they're doing.</p>
<h2 id="the-pubmed-api">The pubmed API</h2>
<p>overview of the api https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/develop/api/</p>
<p>it's mature, ready to build with / on today</p>
<p>overview of what I used it for https://github.com/drcjar/litsearch</p>
<h2 id="fhir-and-e.g-prescriptions">FHIR and e.g prescriptions</h2>
<p>not really ready yet / widely used?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-whats-coming-next">Conclusion and what's coming next</h2>
<p>Open API standards are an important piece of the puzzle for modern digital health services. Next up XYZ.</p>
