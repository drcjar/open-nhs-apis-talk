# open-nhs-apis-talk

## background 

it's a talk about open nhs apis 

Carl and Terence agreed to share a presentation at https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/api-community-meet-up-leeds-tickets-60389632015

It's loosely about open nhs apis but also about the spectacular opportunity cost of the status quo and why we must make NHS IT less bad; hopefully Terence will fix all the things :-)
