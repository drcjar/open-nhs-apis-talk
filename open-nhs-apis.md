# A doctor and a geek perspective: Why Open API Standards in the NHS matter

Carl Reynolds and Terence Eden

## Background - what did the internet ever do for us anyway?

The internet provides unparalleled opportunity for the efficient matching of skills to tasks ("work").

## How does that work?

By making it easier for people to connect; reduces organisational, geographic and fianancial barriers; there's a big pool of people on the internet with a plurality of skill and motivation; they can find work they're a good match for or start their own for a low marginal cost.

## Why does it matter? 

No one organisation (or individual) owns all the talent. Being (selectively) open to contributions from a bigger pool of talent (people on the internet) results in better work. It's the open source model. 

## Examples:

- Android (based on Linux), the most popular smartphone operating system in the world
- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, the three most popular web browsers in the world
- Python, R, Ruby, Java, four of the most popular programming languages in the world
- Twitter, reddit, linkedin, instagram, amazon etc

## What do Open API Standards have to do with the price of cheese?

Open API standards can help to lower barrier to entry (contributing), lowering costs. They can also improve interoperability. More hygenic / scalable design practice? Modularity is good.
