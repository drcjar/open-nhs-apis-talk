## Things are harder than they should be at the hospital

## There are bugs in the hospital software and they're not fixed promptly. This is bad.

## It's not good enough for the computers not to talk to each other in the NHS.

##

So why isn't NHS IT fixed yet? Monopolies/Broken culture/Broken markets? With no ability to make improvements to software used wonkiness persists. Shonky UIs, fragmented and siloed data etc. In some respects, it's the opposite of like on the internet...

##

Why is the internet so great? provides unparalleled opportunity for the efficient matching of skills to tasks ("work"). Works on "rough consensus and running code". If we all speak (roughly) the same language, we can accomplish great things.

## 

The internet makes it easier for people to connect; reduces organisational, geographic and fianancial barriers; big pool of people on the internet with a plurality of skill and motivation; they can find work they're a good match for or start their own for a low marginal cost.

## 

No one organisation (or individual) owns all the talent. Being (selectively) open to contributions from a bigger pool of talent (people on the internet) results in better work. It's the open source model.

Examples

- Android (based on Linux), the most popular smartphone operating system in the world
- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, the three most popular web browsers in the world
- Python, R, Ruby, Java, four of the most popular programming languages in the world
- Twitter, reddit, linkedin, instagram, amazon - all built using open standards.

## 

What do Open API Standards have to do with the price of cheese?

- Open API standards can help to lower barrier to entry (contributing), lowering costs. They can also improve interoperability. More hygenic / scalable design practice? Modularity is good.
- Open APIs stop the NHS from getting locked in to monopolies. Anyone can supply software that reads and produces data in an open standard.

## 

Are SDOs our friends?

- Standards devlelopment organizations are not our unqualified friends. Standard setting is a key part of modern business strategy, the stakes are high, it's a warzone. Basic checks that it's open. Reminder that open source still matters. 
- We have an extensive list of checks to make sure that standards meet our needs - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-principles/open-standards-principles

OpenAPI v3

Formerly known as Swagger. A brilliant way to document APIs. Allows for rapid creation of code. Lets API designers understand what they're doing.

FHIR and e.g prescriptions

not really ready yet / widely used?

so there's plenty to be done in health and...

Open API standards are an important piece of the puzzle for modern digital health services
